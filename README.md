# PrBaAdv_czsl
Previous remarkable works primarily addressed CZSL problem by focusing on disentangling strategy or utilizing object-based conditional probabilities to constrain the selection space of attributes.  We devise a model-agnostic and Primitive-Based Adversarial (PrBaAdv) training method to model this procedure. 
The code will be publicly available at the time of paper review.
